# Root-Finding Methods: Secant & Modified False Position

This project demonstrates and compares **two numerical methods** for solving nonlinear equations:  
**Secant Method** and **Modified False Position Method**.  
The goal is to understand their implementation, performance, and **convergence behavior**.

---

## üéØ Objective
- Implement the **Secant Method** and the **Modified False Position Method** in C++.  
- Compare their efficiency and convergence towards the root.  
- Analyze how each method approaches the solution.

## üìÇ Project Structure

| File Name                 | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `secant.cpp`              | Implements the **Secant Method** to approximate the root of a nonlinear equation using two initial guesses and iterative refinement. |
| `m-falseposition.cpp`     | Implements the **Modified False Position Method**, an improved version of the simple False Position Method for better convergence. |
| `compare.cpp`             | Runs **both methods side by side** and provides a comparative analysis of their **convergence behavior**. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** using GitHub Desktop.  
2. Open the project in an IDE such as **VS Code** or **Code::Blocks** that supports C++.  
3. Compile the `.cpp` files separately. For example:  
   - Run `secant.cpp` ‚Üí Executes the Secant Method.  
   - Run `m-falseposition.cpp` ‚Üí Executes the Modified False Position Method.  
   - Run `compare.cpp` ‚Üí Compares both methods side by side.
